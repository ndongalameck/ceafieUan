In this module, we're going to see how to create a basic Spring MVC application.

00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:14,526
We're going to see all the steps that are required then we're going to talk a little bit

00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:17,576
about the prerequisites that you'll need in order to get started

00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:20,576
